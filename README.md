Snake Game üêç


Overview
This project is a classic implementation of the Snake Game using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The game challenges players to control a growing snake, navigate around the board, and eat food while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own body. The game provides a simple, fun, and interactive way to learn about GUI programming and basic game mechanics in Python.

Brief Explanation
Language & Library:
The game is developed in Python and utilizes the built-in tkinter library for rendering graphics and handling user input.

Gameplay:

The snake moves continuously in the chosen direction (up, down, left, or right) using the arrow keys.

The objective is to eat the red food items that appear randomly on the board. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer and the score increases.

The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or itself.

Key Features:

Real-time keyboard controls for smooth gameplay.

Random food placement.

Score tracking.

Game over detection with a display message.

Code Structure:

The game logic is encapsulated in the SnakeGame class.

Methods include handling movement, collision detection, food placement, and drawing elements on the canvas.

The main game loop updates the game state and redraws the screen at regular intervals.
